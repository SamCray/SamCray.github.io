   <p>My name is Samantha Cray <br> In my spare time I like to read, go on walks, and play video games.
    I have a dog name Chip who enjoys going on the walks with me.
    I have a passion for technology and finally took the leap. I am going to University of Rhode Island
    to earn my degree in Computer Science.
