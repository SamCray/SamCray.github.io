   <p>My name is Samantha Cray <br> In my spare time I like to read, go on walks, and play video games.<br>
    I have a dog name Chip who enjoys going on the walks with me. <br>
    I always had a passion for technology and finally took the leap! I am attending URI to earn my degree in
    Computer Science.
